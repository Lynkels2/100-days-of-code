### Day 3: June 27th, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Today was a good day for me i was able to complete the javascript track. Ran into some basic problems but there's nothing MDN or W3Schools can't solve, Stumbled on Wes Bos 30days javascript challenge i might be trying that too to enhance my skills.

**Thoughts:** I feel a bit skeptical about posting my progress on twitter some days might come when i won't be able to post my progress so better thing to do is update my log file everyday. i am really excited about this journey.

### Day 4: June 28th, 2017
**Today's Progress**: I was able to complete the Object and functional programming challenges. Now tackling the algorithm challenges i'll be starting Wes Bos javascript 30days challenge #fingers crossed hope it goes well.

**Thoughts:** I have been stuck on certain challenges and felt programming is too hard for me but i keep reminding myself the journey is not a smooth one. Look forward to reading this in few months and thinking to myself i made the right choice. too much story....
