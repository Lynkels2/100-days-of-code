# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 25th, 2017 


**Today's Progress**: Finished Building a Personal Portfolio on freecodecamp front-end project.

**Thoughts:** I Struggled with completing this project because the codepen environment is a little bit new to me but guess what i finished within 30minutes of starting out.

### Day 2: June 26th, 2017
**Today's Progress**: On the Javascript track on freecodecamp. I was able to complete the Basic front-end projects. 

**Thoughts:** I Started this journey on freecodecamp last week but started #100DaysOfCode yesterday so here it goes  i look forward to completing this week's challenge. Yaay I just got to 200 on my Map.

### Day 3: June 27th, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Today was a good day for me i was able to complete the javascript track. Ran into some basic problems but there's nothing MDN or W3Schools can't solve, Stumbled on Wes Bos 30days javascript challenge i might be trying that too to enhance my skills.
**Thoughts:**: I feel a bit skeptical about posting my progress on twitter some days might come when i won't be able to post my progress so better thing to do is update my log file everyday. i am really excited about this journey.
