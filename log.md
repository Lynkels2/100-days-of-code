### Day 1: June 25th, 2016 


**Today's Progress**: Finished Building a Personal Portfolio on freecodecamp front-end project.

**Thoughts:** I Struggled with completing this project because the codepen environment is a little bit new to me but guess what i finished within 30minutes of starting out.
